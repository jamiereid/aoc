2018 Advent of Code solutions
=============================

I'm using the Advent Of Code 2018 problems to become more familiar with
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). There will likely be a bit of
over-engineering in these solutions as I want to use this opportunity to become
familiar with some [crates](https://crates.io/) (such as
[`failure`](https://docs.rs/failure/0.1.5/failure/), not just the Rust language
itself.

This repo layout, and the `setup-day` script have been borrowed with love from
[`BurntSushi`'s repo](https://github.com/BurntSushi/advent-of-code).

To run a solution, `cd` into its directory and invoke the program with Cargo:

```
$ cd aoc01
$ cargo run --release input/input.txt
```
